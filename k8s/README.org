#+TITLE: Kubernetes cluster applications

* Technologies
- Kustomize to scaffold, modify and apply patches on top of external resources
- Cert-manager to manage certificates
- metallb to manage ip allocation in the cluster
- calico as the CNI
- ExternalDNS to expose DNS records to Cloudflare
- OKD provides the monitoring stack and a CSI driver with the oVirt deployment

* Kustomize

#+begin_example
kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins something/overlays/prod
kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins something/overlays/prod | kubectl apply -f -
#+end_example

* Deployment

1. Deploy metallb
2. Deploy external-dns
3. Deploy cert-manager
4. Deploy Traefik (has a dependency on Cert Manager and MetalLB)
5. Deploy CSI
6. Deploy the remaining resources

* ExternalDNS
ExternalDNS automatically inserts CNAME entries pointing to ~k8s.qt.rs~ for each ingress defined
and annotated with ~external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target: k8s.qt.rs~.

While I could use a generic =*= CNAME entry that points to ~k8s.qt.rs~, I prefer having
unresolvable domains.
Also, when my ISP will properly support IPv6, I will add =AAAA= records and =CNAME= records for the IPv4 scenario.

Domains that only allow access by administrators (myself) are gated behind an OAuth middleware in Traefik.

* CSI
